# Intro:

During the time of the pandemic, hospitals were flooded with the patients of Covid19. Due to this, the patients of other ailments were not able to get proper treatment and were stuck at their homes with helpless hands. Due to this, the need of online medical apps arose so that doctors can treat their patients without patients being physically present and hence following Covid 19 norms.

So, we have developed an Android application, so that users can communicate with their verified and nearby hospitals in no time and completely and virtually. This app provides complete authentication for users to login and set up their profiles and attach wallets to their respective account which can be further used by them for booking appointments and ordering medicines.

Hospital profiles need to be verified by the admin and verification code will be sent to them with a Unique ID for login purposes. Further, the profiles of hospital owners will be verified by the admin and then only the hospital will have complete access to its profile. Hospitals can upload images of their ICUs, rooms, etc., for user’s convenience.

# Features:

Users can sign up with their details along with valid email and password will be verified and used for further login purposes as  well in case the user forgot the password.

User’s home screen contains options to view details of registered hospitals,book appointments for lab tests, view their appointment’s status, detect disease from their symptoms,order medicines from pharmacy and update their profile in settings.

Users can activate their wallet ( initially 1000 Algos provided) which they can use for transactions.

Hospital needs to register in the app along with complete details with verified phone no. , their profile will be verified by admin and 
Unique ID is provided for further login purposes.

Hospital's Home Screen have options to add medical tests , accept / reject appointments, add medicines to their pharmacy, upload images , update phone numbers.

Brief  description of medicines and lab tests are provided for user understanding.
